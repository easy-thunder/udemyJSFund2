Hello, I'm fairly new to programming, and decided to immerse each lesson through Udem in GitHub. Between most of the lessons I have branched and merged my work.
I realize that there isn't much separation in the JS file which would make it difficult to track where I am at in my progress if you wanted to see what lessons I'm learning. So in my future lessons I'll be sure to comment out some line breaks so that you may take a look at each lesson individually.
I was debating on whether or not to place this as public, however, I have met some Developers that aren't comfortable with version control, thus I decided that demonstrating my comfortability with merging, branching, and pushing was a good idea. I am showing that from the beginning of my training I am learning healthy colaboration workflows.
